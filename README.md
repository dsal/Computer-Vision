# 1. Introduction
Computer Vision (CV) is a field of AI that enables machines to interpret and process visual data (images/videos) to extract useful information. It involves tasks like object detection, image classification, segmentation, and recognition.
CV enables computers to interpret and analyze visual data (images/videos) like humans. It involves feature extraction, pattern recognition, and decision-making using machine learning and deep learning.


| Field | Definition | Common Uses | Wavelengths & Sensors |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Image Processing | Enhancing or modifying images without understanding their content | Noise removal, filtering, edge detection, compression | Optical cameras (RGB, InfraRed), scanners|
| Computer Vision | Teaching machines to interpret images like humans do |Object recognition, facial recognition, autonomous driving | RGB cameras, depth sensors (LiDAR), Infrared cameras |
| Machine Vision | Industrial use of vision systems for inspection and automation | Quality control, robotics, barcode scanning | InfraRed (thermal), X-ray, multispectral cameras|

| Wavelength Range | Type | Sensor Used | Applications |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 0.01-10 nm | X-ray Vision | X-ray detectors | Medical purposes |
| 400-730 nm | Visible Light (RGB) | CMOS, CCD | Image classification, object detection |
| 730-1400 nm | Near-InfraRed (NIR) |NIR Cameras | Eye tracking, night vision |
| 1.4-3 um | Short-wave InfraRed (SWIR) | SWIR Cameras | Eye tracking, night vision |
| 3-14 um | Thermal InfraRed (TIR) | Uncooled microbolometers | Heat detection, surveillance, medical imaging |
| 1 mm -  1 m | Radar | Radar sensors | Automotive collision detection |

# 1.1. Key Components of Computer Vision
Input: Information Retrieval: Accessing and extracting relevant data from large datasets based on content.
How It Relates to CV:
  - Image Search & Retrieval: Finding similar images in a database.
  - Feature Extraction: Identifying patterns (edges, colors, textures).
  - Reverse Image Search: Matching a given image to known references.
    Example: Google Reverse Image Search uses CV to find visually similar images online.
